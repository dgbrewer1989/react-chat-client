# react-chat-client
Simple react based app I've created for using on my local network.

# TODO
- App should be updated to utilize current IP on the network and apply to interactions with the server.
- Unit tests need written for main chat functionality (connection to server, login, etc)
- Update formatting for main chat so its easier on the eyes.
